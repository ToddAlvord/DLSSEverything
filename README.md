A simple version manager for Nvidia DLSS2, DLSS3 and Ray Reconstruction DLLs

I made this because I wanted a simple and straight forward way to scan a directory or drive for all nvidia DLSS related DLLs and to see their current version, with a way to change that version to whatever I want. The other DLSS version managers/applications I've come across only work with certain launchers and/or only replace DLSS2 DLLs. This application finds _any_ DLSS2, DLSS3 and DLSS Ray Reconstruction DLLs regardless of launchers and allows you to change them to the version of your liking.

- Quickly scan your game folders for Nvidia DLLs to see their current version
- Easily download any nvidia DLSS DLL versions you want to use
- Easily replace your game's DLSS DLLs with the version of your choice, or revert back to the original. Simply click the drop down to change to a different version.

What games is this intended for?

- Single player games / offline games
- Online co-op games are generally OK to modify ex Baldurs Gate
- Do not modify DLSS files for any competitive online games, or any games that have anti-cheat software. Most online games have anti cheat software. If you are unsure, do not modify the DLSS files for those games.
